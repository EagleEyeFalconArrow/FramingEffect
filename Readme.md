# Framing Effect

## Introduction

The Framing Effect is a cognitive bias where people are influenced by the way a question is asked. 

This effect is often used in advertising, where a product is presented in a positive light, or in a negative light. For example, a product may be advertised as being "99% fat free", rather than "1% fat". The former is more likely to be perceived as healthy, while the latter is more likely to be perceived as unhealthy. This effect is also used in politics, where a politician may frame an issue in a way that is more likely to attract voters.
